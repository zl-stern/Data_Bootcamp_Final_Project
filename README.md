This project was completed by Zhe Lu in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232,
Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In
particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and eorts of others when submitting written work as our own.
The incorporation of the work of others{including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative
expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or para-
phrasing thereof{ has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text
and the bibliography.
And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester
or in a dierent semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for
the project and course.
